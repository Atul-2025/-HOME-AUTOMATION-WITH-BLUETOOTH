DESCRIPTION

This project is a Bluetooth-based home automation system designed to control electrical appliances wirelessly using a smartphone. The system utilizes a microcontroller with an integrated or external Bluetooth module to receive commands sent from a mobile app. When a command is received, the microcontroller processes it and activates/deactivates the corresponding relays, thereby controlling the connected appliances (lights, fans, etc.).

The project demonstrates how low-cost wireless technology like Bluetooth can be used to create smart, energy-efficient, and convenient living environments. It is especially useful for the elderly or physically challenged individuals, enabling them to control home appliances with minimal effort.

WORKING PRINCIPAL

The smartphone connects to the HC-05 Bluetooth module via a mobile app.

The user sends commands like "A" to turn on a light, or "B" to turn it off.

The microcontroller reads these serial inputs and toggles the corresponding GPIO pins.

Each GPIO pin is connected to a relay, which switches the connected home appliance ON/OFF.

COMPONENT USED

1 ESP32 DEVELOPMENT BOARD

2 Relay Module (1/2/4/8 Channel)

3 5V Power Supply / Adapter / Battery (with connector)

4 Smartphone with Bluetooth Terminal App or Custom App

5 Electrical Appliances (Bulb, Fan, etc.) for control

6 Transistors (e.g., BC547) (optional, for switching logic)

7 Resistors and Capacitors (as needed for interfacing)

8 Breadboard or PCB (for circuit connections)

9 Jumper Wires / Connecting Wires
